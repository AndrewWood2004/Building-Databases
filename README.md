# Background Information

This was a project done over the course of about 2 weeks. Me and a team created an sql database that could take classes, requirements, etc., and create a database to make schedules for classes. I plan to expand on it personally by using 2 Databases to compare how efficiently and effectively they work against each other. 1 uses sql, the other uses Python.
